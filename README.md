Project Title: Puppy Selling Landing Page

Overview: I recently designed and developed a fully responsive landing page dedicated to selling adorable puppies. This project was a great opportunity to apply my HTML, CSS, and web design skills in creating a visually appealing and user-friendly site. The page includes an eye-catching hero section featuring puppy images, clear calls-to-action, and social media icons for branding. The layout is optimized for mobile and desktop, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

Key Features:

1. Engaging hero section with high-quality puppy images.
2. Mobile-first responsive design for all devices.
3. Integration of Font Awesome for social media logos.
4. Clear navigation for an easy user journey.
   
This project challenged me to think creatively and focus on the user experience, while also honing my technical skills in front-end development.
